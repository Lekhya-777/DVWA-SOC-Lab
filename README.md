# DVWA SOC Lab – From Attack to Detection

This project simulates real-world web attacks on DVWA and demonstrates how a SOC analyst can detect them using Apache access logs and a Python-based detection engine.

## Features
- Simulates SQL Injection and Brute Force attacks on DVWA
- Collects real Apache logs generated by attacks
- Python script (`detector.py`) detects:
  - SQL Injection patterns
  - Brute force login behavior
- Generates alerts similar to a SOC environment

## Tech Stack
- Kali Linux
- DVWA
- Apache
- Python

## Learning Outcome
- Understood attacker techniques (SQLi, brute force)
- Learned how logs reflect real attacks
- Built a mini SOC-style detection system
